# Web Development Project 4 - Images from Mars!

Submitted by: Jeremy Galindo

This web app: This website generates random pictures from the Mars Rover API. Below the picture labels the camera used to capture the photo, which can be banned to filter out the data. 

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [✔️] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [✔️] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [✔️] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [✔️] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [✔️] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [✔️] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [✔️] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

It was difficult to find and use an API that was easier for me to understand. I tried to use the Cat and Dog API before the NASA one. After I figured it out the rest of the project wasn't too bad.
